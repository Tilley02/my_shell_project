<!-- Welcome to my shell -->
<!-- This is my simple shell written in c. That has basic commands programmed into it and simple error handeling,
     To use the shell just type in some of the commands below or if you type one not here it will fork the shell
     to one that has the command in it to use and then exit back to my one -->



<!-- Commands in it -->
<!-- cd command:
     The user can cd to a directory, this requires another input then to cd to so cannot work by itself will show
     an error if you just type cd by itself -->

<!-- clr(clear) command:
     Clears the users screen and brings the prompt up to the top of the terminal screen -->

<!-- dir command
     Lists all the files and directories in a current directory in long format -->

<!-- environ command
     Lists all the enviroment variables to a user -->

<!-- echo command
     Prints out what the users types back to them excluding the echo part -->

<!-- help command
     Brings the user to the help manual you are reading now, where you can look at what commands do -->

<!-- pause command
     Puts the terminal on pause until the user presses the enter key-->

<!-- quit command
     Exits the terminal back to the users terminal -->



<!-- Concepts explained -->
<!-- I/O redirection
     Input/Output redirection is the changing of a programms either input source for input (>) or output source for output (<)
     this means for input a user can take their input from a file they might have somewhere on their computer instead of type
     the input and the same for output a user can tell the output of their programm where to go to i.e what file where.
     When redirecting output if a file exists it writes over it unless you use two arrows i.e << then it will add you
     content to the end of it and if the file does not exist it will create the file for you -->


<!-- Program enviroment -->
<!-- The program enviroment is the variables and values set in the programm when it is executed, that allow a user to run
      a program, an example of this is the cd command cd is set to change directory you just have to tell it where to-->


<!-- Background program execution -->
<!-- This is when a program runs in the background of the users machine while they are working on something else, this can be 
     achieved by using the ampersand (&) symbol at the end of your input on the command line -->
